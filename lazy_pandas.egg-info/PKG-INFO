        Project 7: Lazy Evaluation of Python Pandas
        
        In many cases, Pandas is used within Python environments in an ad-hoc way: 
        users submitting pandas commands as needed. As the analysis mature, these 
        ad-hoc programs make their way into scripts and processing pipelines. 
        There's an opportunity to increase the performance of those pipelines 
        if the processing 'plan' was known a priori. The goal of this project is
        to define what is a good format for such processing plan and then build an artifact
        that can extract processing plans from imperative-style Python programs.
